        <h1>Solution: Refactoring for Salary Calculation System</h1>
        <p>To address the limitations and issues identified in the current salary calculation system, we propose the following refactoring approach:</p>
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Use of Interface or Abstract Class:</strong> Introduce an interface or abstract class that defines a method for calculating employee salaries. This abstraction will serve as a contract for all types of employees.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Implement Different Salary Calculation Strategies:</strong> Implement concrete classes for each type of employee (e.g., regular employees, managers, hourly workers) that extend the interface or abstract class and provide specific implementations for calculating salaries based on their respective structures (e.g., monthly salary, base salary plus bonuses, hourly rate).</p>
        <p><strong>3. Encapsulate Salary Calculation Logic:</strong> Encapsulate the salary calculation logic within each concrete class. This separation of concerns allows for easier maintenance and extension of the system without modifying existing code.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Utilize Polymorphism:</strong> Utilize polymorphism to invoke the appropriate salary calculation method based on the type of employee, ensuring that the system remains open for extension (e.g., adding new types of employees) but closed for modification (e.g., altering existing salary calculation logic).</p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Flexibility:</strong> The refactored system can accommodate different types of employees with varying salary structures, supporting future scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>Adherence to OCP:</strong> By adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, the system reduces the risk of introducing errors and improves maintainability.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Code Quality:</strong> Separation of concerns and use of abstraction lead to cleaner, more modular code that is easier to understand and maintain.</li>
        </ul>
